# Analyze Scan Results

This folder contains all files related to analyzing the network scan results obtained from the SYN scan performed in the previous step.

## Contents

- `results_analyzer.py`  
  A Python script designed to parse the Nmap scan results, extract open ports and services, and generate a summarized report.

- `actual_report.md`  
  Actual markdown report generated by `results_analyzer.py` which summarizes the findings of the scan including IP addresses, open ports, and detected services.

- `analysis_screenshot.png`  
  A screenshot demonstrating the output or execution of the analysis script, showing how the results are presented.

## What I Did

- Developed a Python script to automate parsing of the scan result file.
- Extracted useful information such as IP addresses, open ports, and service names.
- Generated a clear, formatted report in Markdown for easy reading and documentation.
- Captured a screenshot of the analysis process for reference.

## How to Use

1. Place your scan result file (e.g., `scan_results.txt`) in this folder or modify the script to point to your file location.
2. Run the analysis script:

```bash
python3 results_analyzer.py
