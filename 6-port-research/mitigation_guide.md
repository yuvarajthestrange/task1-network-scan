## Port 53 - DNS Service

**Common Risks:**  
- DNS cache poisoning  
- DNS spoofing  
- Amplification attacks

**Mitigation Strategies:**  
- Use DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) to protect DNS data integrity.  
- Restrict DNS queries to authorized clients only.  
- Implement rate limiting to prevent DNS amplification attacks.  
- Regularly update DNS server software to patch vulnerabilities.  
- Monitor DNS traffic for unusual patterns.

## Port 7070 - RealServer Streaming Server

**Common Risks:**  
- Unauthorized access to streaming services  
- Buffer overflow vulnerabilities leading to remote code execution  
- Information disclosure through misconfigured services

**Mitigation Strategies:**  
- Restrict access to the streaming service via firewall rules or VPN.  
- Keep the RealServer software updated with the latest security patches.  
- Disable unnecessary features and services within RealServer.  
- Use strong authentication mechanisms where applicable.  
- Regularly monitor logs for suspicious activity.

## General Recommendations

- Conduct regular network scans to identify new open ports or services.  
- Implement host-based and network firewalls to control inbound/outbound traffic.  
- Employ intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to detect and block malicious activities.  
- Educate network users about safe security practices.
