# Port Research

This folder contains research and documentation related to the common network ports found open during the scan, their associated security risks, and mitigation strategies.

## Contents

- `port_risks.csv`: A CSV file listing common ports, the services running on them, and potential security risks.
- `mitigation_guide.md`: A markdown guide outlining mitigation techniques and best practices for securing open ports.
- `risk_matrix.png`: A visual risk matrix that categorizes ports based on their risk levels.

## Objective

The goal of this step was to research the services commonly running on the detected open ports from the scan, identify associated security risks, and suggest mitigation strategies to reduce exposure.
