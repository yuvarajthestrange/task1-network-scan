# Export Results

This directory contains scripts and files related to exporting and saving network scan results.

## Description

The `export_script.sh` script performs a SYN scan using Nmap on the subnet `192.168.136.201/24` and saves the output to `scan_results.txt`.

The scan results include details of hosts found, open ports, and their services within the specified subnet. This helps in understanding the network surface and potential vulnerabilities.

## Files

- `export_script.sh`: Bash script to run the SYN scan and export results.
- `actual_report.html`: HTML formatted report of the scan results.
- `export_screenshot.png`: Screenshot showing the execution or results of the export process.
- `scan_results.txt`: (Generated by running `export_script.sh`) Contains raw Nmap output of the scan.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Nmap installed on your system.
2. Run the export script:
   ```bash
   ./export_script.sh

Check the scan_results.txt file for the raw scan output.

Open actual_report.html in a browser to view the formatted scan report.
