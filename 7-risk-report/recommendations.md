# Recommendations for Improving Network Security

Based on the risk assessment from the recent network port scan, the following recommendations should be implemented to enhance security:

1. **Implement Firewall Rules:**
   - Block unnecessary ports at the perimeter firewall.
   - Allow only trusted IP addresses to access critical services.

2. **Patch and Update Services:**
   - Keep all network services up to date with the latest security patches.
   - Subscribe to security advisories related to services in use.

3. **Network Segmentation:**
   - Separate critical services from general user networks.
   - Use VLANs or subnetting to reduce attack surfaces.

4. **Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Enable detailed logging on critical servers.
   - Use IDS/IPS systems to detect suspicious activity on open ports.

5. **Regular Scanning and Assessment:**
   - Conduct frequent vulnerability scans and penetration testing.
   - Address identified vulnerabilities promptly.

6. **Access Controls and Authentication:**
   - Use strong authentication mechanisms for sensitive services.
   - Limit user privileges to the minimum necessary.

By following these recommendations, the organization can significantly reduce its exposure to network-based attacks and ensure a more robust security posture.
